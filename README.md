# ImageRecognitionNeuralNetwork
 Neural network for image classification with Tensorflow.<br>
 All weights are saved in training_4 folder.<br>
 I created it using Sequential model and tested using CIFAR10 dataset. It can classify these types of images:<br>
 ```text
 ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']
 ```
The accuracy of the network:<br>
 ```text
loss: 0.6643 - accuracy: 0.7652 - val_loss: 0.8812 - val_accuracy: 0.7010
```
